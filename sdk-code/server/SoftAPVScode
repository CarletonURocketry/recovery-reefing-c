Soft Access point

-	Start by installing the raspberry pi pico plug in in vscode – should be able to get C to work for the pico
-	I am working on a mac so processes can vary

Setting Up the Pico W Build Environment
1.	Installed Dependencies
o	Installed Homebrew on macOS.
o	Used Homebrew to install CMake and ARM GCC toolchain for cross-compiling.
2.	VS Code Setup
o	Installed the Raspberry Pi Pico extension and C/C++ extension.
o	Configured the Pico SDK via the VS Code Pico extension (default SDK path, auto-detected toolchain).
3.	Project Creation and Build
o	Created a new project folder with board set to pico_w.
o	From the project root, created a build/ folder, ran cmake .. to configure the build system, and make to generate the .uf2 firmware file.
o	Verified the .uf2 file was successfully generated in build/ for flashing onto the Pico W

Setting up the softAP
-	cyw43_arch_init()this is a built in function in sdk to initialize wifi card on pico w
-	cyw43_arch_enable_ap_mode("MySSID", "mypassword", CYW43_AUTH_WPA2_AES_PSK); another built in func in sdk 
o	CYW43 is the wifi chip the pico w has
o	Can be changed to include a wifi signal without a password
o	This sets the wifi chip to ap mode
o	Also sets up internal DHCP 
o	Assuming it is fine to use the built in func because they will be setup prior to launch
-	cyw43_arch_deinit(); also built in func basically a cleanup
-	
 To run code
cd build
-	Just for organization sake 
cmake ..
-	Reads cmake.txt
-	Generates makefiles on how to compile the code
make
-	Reads the files generated by cmake 
-	Compiles your source files into .o object files
-	Links objects into one executable
-	 Creates a .elf file (executable)
-	Converts it into a .uf2 for flashing the Pico
-	
At this point the .uf2 file can be flashed onto the pico and should boot up when it is turned on

How to flash file 
1.	On the pico enter bootloader mode (hold down bootsel)
2.	Connect computer to pico with usb
3.	After compiling there will be a .uf2 file in the build folder
4.	Move this file to the RPI-RP2 drive on the pico
5.	Reboot pico
